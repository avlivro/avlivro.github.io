He&#8217;s a grown man who works as a police inspector in Portland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the course of the story, his path crosses with the Yonce family, in particular with their daughter Delia, after whose death he begins the pursuit of her killer. Galbraith is the main character of &#8220;Tempo De Constru\u00e7\u00e3o Novamente&#8221; and &#8220;Qualquer ou Uma Grande Recompensa&#8221;. He also appears briefly in &#8220;Uma Moldura Quebrada&#8221;. Galbraith never appears in &#8220;Que Dif\u00edcil \u00e9 Ser Escravo de Deus!&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Appearance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Galbraith is a 31-year-old man whose name is of Gallic origin. He has short black hair and a neat mustache under his nose. Those around him describe him as a very tall man with a military bearing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wears a strict gray suit with a white checkered shirt and a black tie, and he has two copies of this suit. He never wears anything else during the performance, except when he puts on a medical gown at the request of the scientists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of the work, Galbraith is shown as a slightly lazy and phlegmatic character, but the more his fate intersects with Delia Yonce, the more unhinged his behavior becomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Personality<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>I really don&#8217;t like this state of affairs myself, but you can rest assured\u2026<\/em><\/p>\n<cite>\u2014Galbraith&#8217;s reaction regarding death of Delia Yonce<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As an immigrant from Gloucester, he has a strange attitude towards American culture, almost despising it, although upon returning to England he also cannot find a place for himself in his homeland, due to which Galbraith is essentially a &#8220;man without a country.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has little interest in literature and films, but in his heart he is partial to the fine arts, but he never managed to realize his dream, because as a child he was oppressed by his father, and as an adult, due to his profession as a police inspector, he cannot afford such a hobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is described that Galbraith loves to smoke, buying a lot of cigarettes at once, in addition, he loves to drink alcoholic beverages, happily drinking both cheap whiskey and expensive fruit liqueur. Galbraith loves coffee, but hates tea. Upon arrival in England, he becomes very particular about the quality of food that is offered to him in osterias and restaurant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He usually behaves quite calmly, but depending on the situation, Galbraith can suddenly lose his temper, but such outbursts of anger quickly pass. It is implied that he is somewhat cowardly in nature, and some characters outright tell him that Galbraith is naive and timid. He often makes illogical actions, because of which Galbraith then has to get out for a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He hates family life, being, as he himself says, an &#8220;ideological bachelor&#8221; (Galbraith is a virgin), but at the same time, for some reason, he is imbued with sympathy for Delia Yonce, and upon the fact of her death, he loses his temper and is going to do whatever no matter how to take revenge on her killer. Galbraith was probably predisposed to adopt Delia, being otherwise unable to have children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biography<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Galbraith was born in 1960 in Gloucester, England. He had known doctor Baselard since childhood, who visited his father&#8217;s house, where future inspector lived until college age, after which, for reasons not described in the story, Galbraith moved to Portland, USA, where he entered the police academy where he meets Pharqraut, with whom he chooses the profession of police inspector<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, at the request of Pharqraut, he visits hospitalized mister Yonce, after which he becomes familiar with the case of his friend, after which Galbraith begins to see strange visions on the streets of Portland, and the next day after the hallucination in the passage Pharqraut is shot by unknown men in black .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a meeting at mister chief inspector Schaeymoure&#8217;s home, he is called to the Parkrose Neighborhood the next day on the suicide of Ivette Yonce. At the scene, he interrogates her daughter Delia Yonce, but he does not have time to escort her, as Schaeymoure calls him again for an audience. Leaving Delia in the custody of an F.B.I. agent, Galbraith arrives at the police station, where mister chief inspector gives him a full day off, which he spends first getting drunk at a bar and then watching movie &#8220;Es ist nicht leicht ein Gott zu sein&#8221; at a bootleg German cinema.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day he learns that Delia Yonce has died after surgery. Galbraith finds the address of the man who led the operation and arrives at the place where he miraculously discovers the right person, doctor Baselard, whom he, it turns out, had the honor of seeing in his childhood. When the inspector finds a photograph of Duncan, a victim of brain surgery, doctor Baselard leaves the apartment and flees America for England, while Galbraith himself, on the advice of Schaeymoure, visits the Columbia River Correctional Institution, where he asks for an audience with Jordan Thurlow, the man who was suspected of harassing the late Delia Yonce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an audience with Jordan Thurlow, Galbraith begins to prove to his superiors that he needs to pursue Dr. Basil, to which they react as stupid and meaningless speeches. Then mister chief inspector himself arrives directly at his apartment, who reveals to Galbraith the details that Schaeymoure himself personally knows killer of Delia Yonce and warns that doctor Baselard could have killed Duncan with the tacit consent of the patient (which should indicate that Delia Yonce herself asked Baselard to kill her).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after this, in mid-October, Galbraith&#8217;s superiors allow him to continue the search for Delia&#8217;s killer and book a hotel in London, where he immediately flies. Upon arrival in England, he notices that a young man is following him, and then a certain gray-haired man arrives at his hotel room, introducing himself as a computer specialist, whom Galbraith suspects of having a connection with doctor Baselard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the mysterious guest leaves, Galbraith goes to the restaurant, but on the way the taxi driver drops him off in the steppe, where the inspector witnesses a recreated scene of mister Yonce shoots the dog of Jordan Thurlow and almost killing the rapist himself with his daughter. The taxi driver soon picks up Galbraith and upon arrival at the restaurant gives him his phone number. At the end of an unsuccessful meal, the inspector calls the taxi driver&#8217;s number and ends up in his home police department, where lieutenant Nelissen tells him that Jordan Thurlow died in Columbia River Correctional Institution from throat cancer and that Baselard&#8217;s assistants removed a strange tumor from the uterus of the late Delia Yonce, which was given to Oregon College of Oriental Medicine as a medical exhibit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this telephone conversation Galbraith again notices the mysterious young stranger who had been following him since the morning. Galbraith gets into a taxi and goes to his hotel, which inexplicably caught fire while the inspector was away. Right there, Galbraith receives a stampless envelope from the postman, after which the inspector decides to go to &#8220;Makoto Computerization Institute&#8221;, which the morning guest told him. During this trip, Galbraith reads the letter and notices that time around him has moved forward two months, to December 27th.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then solves a puzzle given to him by the unnamed author of the letter, after which he finally arrives at the address where he discovers that this &#8220;Makoto Computerization Institute&#8221; is an underground institute where scientists in England and Japan have jointly created an D.O.O.R., an eternal supercomputer that simulates virtual reality. After visiting the institute, Galbraith rises to the surface and, humming a song from the movie &#8220;Es ist nicht leicht ein Gott zu sein&#8221;, waits for a taxi\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quotes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><em>&#8220;In the garden elder, and in Vancouver earl.&#8221;<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>&#8220;Ah, you go with the mysticism again.
