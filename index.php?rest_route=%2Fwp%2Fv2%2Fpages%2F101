But we are not pigs! We are humans, we unbecoming to be animals. We must understand who we are and why we came into this world.

I had to sell almost all of her things, and this was the only income at that evil days.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: You did not answer me.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Sorry, I don&#8217;t really want to talk about this topic.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: To me you can open your whole soul as it is.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Well. The fact is that I am a professional procrastinator &#8211; in other words, an very lazy person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: Dearie! You can&#8217;t laugh at other people\u2019s shortcomings &#8211; everyone has them. And, of course, you have no less of them than anyone else.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: It&#8217;s okay, madam, do not reproach the child for the fact that adult conversations are funny to him. You yourself, probably, behaved in the same way in your youth. It will pass with age.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: Well, mister Thurlow. Let it be your way.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: All my adult life I tried to delay the moment, when I have to start working for a living. When I was younger, I lamented that society was not able to easily give benefits to everyone and everyone. But, as you understand, the cornucopia is just a utopian symbol, and therefore, with a heavy heart, I had to agree with the foundations of our imperfect world.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: Curious, so are you satisfied with your profession? I know she don&#8217;t make a lot of money.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: It&#8217;s not so much about the money. I went down the path of a culturologist solely because, so as not to spend a lot of time at work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: You want to say that even this job exhausts all your strength?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: I believe that a person should not live only by labour. I hated the idea of becoming some kind of salesclerk or steward &#8211; because others will treat you not as an individual, but only as a screw in a social structure. Such work deprives me of the possibility of self-expression, and my nature does not accept this.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: I would not say that I am satisfied with your outlook on life. I wonder how your late mother felt about this?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: She wasn&#8217;t happy with it either. She constantly lamented, seeing how I wasted her money to no purpose. I understood how hard it was for her, because she had to earn a living and my upbringing alone\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: Did you consider yourself not a good son?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Hard to give answer. I never claimed to be an outstanding person. Parents tend to idealize their children, but the child wants to be himself first and foremost, and I was no exception.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: Oh, those children\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter N.VI<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ivette Yonce: My Lord!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: What&#8217;s been going on?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ivette Yonce: You didn&#8217;t follow her grave at all!

I found what we need! Here is a interesting story, written by Leonard Austener.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Wait, the author of the book is a certain Edward Coleman?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: You do not understand, he just compiled this compilation, and the creators of fairy tales are all different!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Well, I guess you know best.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: So, &#8220;Zelandyne in Seventhaven&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Seventhaven is a magical town that was located on a celestial island hidden from mortal&#8217;s eyes. It was possible to get there only by climbing the crystalline staircase, which appeared only in the deep night and only in one place &#8211; in one area at High Road&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Yes, of course, what else can a town in skies be called, if not seventh heaven.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: There may be a play on words here.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Only six inhabitants lived in this magical town. It was Mason, who built houses, Metalsmith, who forged all sorts of useful things, Miner mined gems and gold, Montero hunted and fed everyone else, Medic help them with their health and only one twiddler Minstrel did nothing but useless versifying. And, of course, the town was ruled by a severe Mayor&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Hold on. You said there were six, and the mayor is not considered a inhabitant?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Huh, six inhabitants in a town, to say nothing of the mayor.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Well, like Jerome.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;All Seventhaven&#8217;s inhabitants have one thing in common &#8211; each of them was over two thousand years old, and they never appeared in front of people. But this does not mean that seventhavenians did not know about the existence of mortals &#8211; on the contrary, those gems mined by Miner, they were going to give it to people, but with one condition &#8211; when people stop making the warfares and killing their own kind&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: They&#8217;ll do it when the pigs fly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;For real this whole story began in Ducal Chateau. It was inhabited by a young marchioness Zelandyne, which was called so because it is just a very beautiful name&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I do not agree with it!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: What are you talking about?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Every name must have a meaning! For instance, my mother called me a Greek word, which means &#8220;always visible&#8221;!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Hm&#8217;mm, It was very curious to hear\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Delia, you really must excuse me, but I think, that thy mother swindled thee.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I just know a thing or two about Hellen culture, and I know that the name &#8220;Delia&#8221; means only &#8220;born on the island of Delos&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Incidentally, to one Greek goddess, specifically Artemis, your name was used just as an epithet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Solidly, isn&#8217;t it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I sense\u2026 How a wave of truth extinguished the fire of falsehood.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: You have a rich vocabulary!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Okay, everything is clear with me, but after whom was the marchioness from the fairy tale named then?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Do you mean Zelandyne? Well, I don&#8217;t even know\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: There is a herb with a very similar name, that still weed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: No-no, wait, I think I remembered something. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, celandine itself was so named because it bloomed when the swallows returned, and withered after they flew away.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: I never looked before at that point in detail. Now adapt this into a fairy tale for a our young lady.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Good. Assume that marchioness was named Zelandyne, because her mother watched the swallows that flew near the walls of the their chateau.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: That&#8217;s quite another matter! It already makes sense!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: You are intelligent girl.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;The young marchioness lived in luxury and abundance, and in everyday life she was surrounded by theurgical creatures. For example, in the morning Zelandyne woke up that Sunny Bunny, who descended from the window with the first rays of sunshine, rang his bell over her pillow&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;But not only the young marchioness had her theurgical pet. The Duchess, her mother, had with her Potted Fairy &#8211; a tiny woman with wings who lived in a small pot and did not need food or drink, but could work miracles. However, The Duchess could easily do without her charms, for she herself was a sorceress, but this did not prevent her from tormenting little beauty with the same question every day &#8211; &#8220;How long will I to sit on the throne?&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Hmm, why did she ask her such a query?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I think this should be understood as an allegory for the fact that Zelandyne&#8217;s mother was afraid of approaching old age.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: But what about the obvious authority in the country?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Don&#8217;t you understand what governance is, Jo? The Duchess is not a The Queen, but rather, the owner of several plots of land, on which she can dispose, but no more.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Wait, so you mean to tell me that\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: All right, stop it! I did not come to visit ajussi Japh in order to listen to such controversies!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Well, from the mouths of Delia shall come the truth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;So, Potted Fairy always answered her mistress the same &#8211; that The Duchess will reign happily ever after. Such an answer delighted the narcissistic woman. But she resorted not only to magic &#8211; almost all related to power were in charge by Chief Executor of Royal Wishes&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Who was that? Never heard of post like this.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Well, it&#8217;s not hard to guess that this man fulfilled any desires of the insidious duchess.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: But why is he exactly &#8220;Executor&#8221;?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: This is just a play on words again. He simultaneously executes both pleasant and violent requests.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: All right.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Job title Chief Executor of Royal Wishes at the court of The Duchess was established a long time ago &#8211; the person that will be discussed was a descendant in the third tribe. On his own, he was a great implementer &#8211; it was not difficult for him to sneak anywhere and quietly eavesdrop on the conspiracies of any interesting personalities who inspired fear in his proprietress. On that day, he ran into the throne room and reported that the army of the neighboring country was defeated, and their leader was captured. This good news pleased The Duchess so much that they immediately awarded him a medal &#8220;For The Pleasant News&#8221;. And her daughter, marchioness Zelandyne, at that time communicated with two unusual inhabitants of Ducal Chateau&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I want you to guess for yourself who the marchioness was talking to.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I&#8217;ll give you a hint, their names started with the letter &#8220;C&#8221;. C&amp;C.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Chancellor &amp; Councillor.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: It was a good try, but not, Zelandyne was not talking to people.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: With whom, maybe animals?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: No, with vegetables.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter N.XIII<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Cactus and Chamomile, who grew up in the parlour, had the ability to speak like humans. When Zelandyne had nothing to do, she sat down on a chair in front of the window and listened, how her green friends tell her about what has been and what will be in the world. That day they told marchioness that today she is eighteen years old, and on this occasion, they want to please her with the news that she will meet her fiance, who, as was customary in those distant times, should give her a heart pierced by an arrow. When Zelandyne, delighted by this news, immediately went to the palace hall, Cactus and Chamomile began to whisper among themselves about who the mysterious chosen one of marchioness would look like&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I think it&#8217;s definitely not a prickly peyote!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Some will wonder why the marchioness was so pleased with the news of her birthday. It&#8217;s simple &#8211; the mother tried her best to keep her daughter in the dark about her age, because she was afraid that when the girl turned eighteen, she would not refuse the opportunity to take her place on the throne. Of course, Zelandyne never even thought of that &#8211; all she wanted that day was on the occasion of her birthday throw a merry-making. Approaching the palace hall, on the way she already imagined, how hundreds of candles were lit in it, and hundreds of guests entered, with the arrival of which began the bona fide ball. The marchioness saw with her own eyes the graceful cavaliers, who, sparkling in their eyes and clinking their spurs, danced with elegant ladies, and at the very end of the hall she saw the silhouette of a beautiful young man, to whom she wanted to throw herself into the arms&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: It sounded boring.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Just be patient, in each fairy tale there are few interesting descriptions of secular life.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Okay.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;But alas, in fact, there was a copper cauldron in the palace hall, into which the marchioness&#8217;s mother threw milkweed leaves, snake fangs and wasp stings. The poisonous brew foamed and seethed, and the sorceress herself furiously whispered over it the words of some spells. When the water finally flooded the coals that lay under the cauldron, The Duchess began to interrogate the prisoner in the chain youthful Sagamore, whom, by her silent decree, the guards brought. She wanted to ask the captive, where hide old men, women and children of broken, but not conquered country. But youthful Sagamore, even under penalty of death, did not tell her anything!&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: He&#8217;re brave, daring heart!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;When The Duchess understood, what youthful Sagamore does not agree to commit treason to his motherland, she called the guards behind her and, leaving the prisoner alone, went to give instructions to the slaughterers. Just at that moment, Zelandyne reached the palace hall, and what was the surprise of the marchioness when she caught sight of a handsome, but exhausted and chained young man! She immediately rushed to youthful Sagamore and started asking questions, to which he willingly answered, because he felt a kindred spirit in the girl. Hearing his sad story, the heart of the young marchioness was filled with readiness to regain freedom to youthful Sagamore, but what could her fragile hands do?&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: I wonder what ideology adhered Leonard Austener, who wrote this fairy tale?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: What are you even talking about?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Just think about this, mate, this author has a representative of the feudal class became sympathetic to the leader of the oppressed people. Don&#8217;t you find that this is some kind of prerequisite for mutiny, a overturn?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Will you please stop!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I agree with you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;But at this time in the palace hall came back the Zelandyne&#8217;s mother, who, having found her daughter next to the prisoner, immediately ordered to send youthful Sagamore to the dungeon, and she herself attacked the marchioness with loud reproaching cries. When The Duchess realized that objurgations would not help the cause, she gave Zelandyne a pearl-encrusted diadem. In this sparkling attire, the young marchioness seemed so beautiful to everyone, that after her departure, the alarmed woman immediately rushed to her chambers, that ask the Potted Fairy. Answer of little beauty scared her in earnest &#8211; according to her forecasts, Zelandyne was supposed to throw The Duchess off the throne any minute&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I just thought The Duchess was a bit like my mommy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Interesting, what exactly?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: To tell the truth, mother also has the same mood swings &#8211; then it seems to her that everything is against her, and the next second she is imbued with a great love for the world.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: How many years your mom?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: I don&#8217;t know the exact age, but she is younger than her fifty-year-old husband by about twenty years.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: So, thirty something. Midlife crisis, what to take from her\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;As soon as The Duchess heard Potted Fairy&#8217;s prediction, how her soul was immediately filled with hatred and envy for her own daughter, and she decided to take revenge on the young marchioness. She went through many ways of revenge in her head, and in the end decided sell Zelandyne into slavery to some sea-wolf, who then plowed the sea on their huge schooners. The Duchess immediately called for auld Jaeger, over over which she constantly abusing, and ordered him to carry out her order. Auld Jaeger did not dare to disobey his proprietress and took Zelandyne behind the walls of Ducal Chateau. Passing through the gate, he was about to head to the harbour, where the trading schooners were anchored, but fortunately for the marchioness, they got in the way of Clever Crow, who prompted auld Jaeger, that he can just leave the girl on the High Road, but himself return to The Duchess and report her, that the girl was killed on the way by marauders. Auld Jaeger, who was tormented by sympathy for Zelandyne, immediately followed the wise advice of the bird and turned back to Ducal Chateau, and \u0421lever Crow in turn hid in the branches of an ancient oak that grew by the pathway. Unhappily, The Duchess at the first words of auld Jaeger understood, that she was deceived, and, without listening to his story to the end, ordered her guards to seize auld Jaeger and take into courtyard to trophy guillotine &#8211; the very one that her soldiers got in the war with the people of youthful Sagamore&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: He shouldn&#8217;t have listened other animal&#8217;s advice.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: In your words contains a kernel of truth, but, in my opinion, it is indecent to laugh at death.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: So auld Jaeger is fabled! What&#8217;s wrong with laughing at the death of a fictional character?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Zelandyne was left alone on the High Road. It was night outside, and the young marchioness became frightened and frightened. Afraid of the dark, she began to call her voice to the night skies, and soon to her desperate cries from the darkness arrived Clever Crow, which already familiar to us. Seeing Zelandyne, he ordered her to follow a swarm of kind-hearted fireflies glowing in the gloom. Young marchioness followed his advice, and finally the insects led her to the crystalline staircase, that led straight to heaven. Zelandyne climbed it and ended up in an amazing place, where, among countless clouds, an island soared, on which, among flowers and trees, there were small, but very lovely lodges, with red tiled roofs and white round walls. When the young marchioness came closer to the settlement, a nimble and agile little man ran out to meet her, in one hand was a lute, and in the other a sheet of paper covered with ink&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: It was Minstrel?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Well, who else would it be? And, as you already guessed, the marchioness ended up in Seventhaven, same magical town!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: All right, It&#8217;s so obvious.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter N.XIV<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;As soon as the little man saw the marchioness, he began to sing loudly and play the lute, and soon to the sound of his music from lodges started coming out other inhabitants of the heavenly town. As soon as they gathered in full force on the street, the oldest looking little man approached Zelandyne and began to interrogate her, who is she and how did she end up in their magical town. Young marchioness did not lie and answered honestly, that this day she turned eighteen years old, and that her mother kicked her out of the home, not even allowing to celebrate this wonderful red-letter day. The inhabitants of the heavenly city were imbued with sympathy for Zelandyne and decided to let her stay with them. Mayor immediately gave the order to build a dwelling for the marchioness, which Mason managed in just ten minutes, because he was always ready all necessary tools and materials&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: It&#8217;s kind of unrealistic, isn&#8217;t it\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Ajussi Jo, you forgot it was a fairy tale! It doesn&#8217;t have to be realistic!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Truth is on your side.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Inhabitant of Seventhaven never regretted that the young marchioness settled in their town &#8211; for good Zelandyne paid good, she constantly took care of everyone and baked delicious pies for all her new friends, what they liked very much, for up to this point they had lived on the simple baked meat of animals that Montero had hunted. Besides twiddler Minstrel, who happened to see the marchioness before others, composed about her a very tender ballad, in which he praised her beauty and kindness, and also did not fail to blame her mother for how unfairly she treated her daughter. When he read this ballad to the marchioness herself, heart of Zelandyne filled with a warm feeling for Minstrel, but she did not reciprocate him, for she thought of the youthful Sagamore, whom she supposed was still languishing in captivity with The Duchess&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: By the way, for a long time we have not heard something about what happened in Ducal Chateau.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: You&#8217;re about to find out.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Marchioness&#8217; Mother was not satisfied, how auld Jaeger disposed of her daughter&#8217;s life &#8211; butchering him on the guillotine, the woman, without wasting a minute, decided to dress like a beggar maid and make one&#8217;s way through Seventhaven, why did she invite Chief Executor of Royal Wishes. The point was that since The Duchess lived all her life in splendour, she was completely unaware how does it &#8211; to ask for alms. Chief Executor of Royal Wishes spent two whole days with her a couple of exercises, but The Duchess was a very bad schooldame &#8211; she constantly broke into a secular tone, which was totally unacceptable to play the role of a beggar maid. Realizing that it will not lead to anything good, her teacher decided to take up the matter himself &#8211; Chief Executor of Royal Wishes turned to Potted Fairy and asked her to turn him into a pauper. The effect exceeded all expectations &#8211; young man at the behest of a little beauty transformed into an elderly man dressed in dirty rags. One of his eyes was hidden behind a black bandage, and both legs were so crooked, that without a crutch he was completely helpless. From now on, no one could doubt that it&#8217;s not subdolous Chief Executor of Royal Wishes, but just an elder and diseased cripple who needs an attitude adjustment&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: You can keep reading.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: All right.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;At the end of servant&#8217;s metamorphosis The Duchess handed the cripple a phial of poison, one drop of which was enough to send Zelandyne to The Land of Eternal Dreams. Bowing to his proprietress, Chief Executor of Royal Wishes went out the gate of Ducal Chateau and, waiting for the night, climbed the crystalline staircase into Seventhaven, where, having found the lodge of the young marchioness, he splashed poison on her and immediately rushed to run. however, he made a mistake in his calculations, in courage throwing a phial on the floor &#8211; the sound of breaking glass immediately woke up all six inhabitants of the town, who, led by Mayor, rushed in pursuit of the cripple, whose crooked legs have done him a disservice &#8211; unable to break away from the persecution, Chief Executor of Royal Wishes lost his crutch and was forced to stop halfway to the descent into ground. And then he had a bad time &#8211; very bad! Worse than ever!&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: So, what happened to this vile villain?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: I think that Seventhaven&#8217;s inhabitants just threw him down the stairs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;When the cripple was finished, the inhabitants of Seventhaven returned to the lodge, where the poor marchioness lay motionless in bed &#8211; the poison that Chief Executor of Royal Wishes splashed on Zelandyne&#8217;s face, plunged the girl into such a deep sleep, that she could not be awakened by any forces. Seventhavenians were gripped by immense grief, and even severe and incredulous Mayor sobbed inconsolably, kneeling by the bed on which lay the lifeless body of the young marchioness. However, soon in Seventhaven our old friend Clever Crow flew in, who explained to the saddened residents how to save the girl &#8211; all that was needed for this was to bring a youthful Sagamore into the magical town, who still languished in the dungeon of The Duchess &#8211; because they are with Zelandyne love each other!&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: This is sounds like a tired mantra. Awakening a girl from sleep by kissing\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Certainly not, ajussi Jo! It&#8217;s so romantic!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: I guess in fairness, in the tale there is not a one word about what exactly was supposed to awaken the marchioness! Maybe a kiss, or maybe something completely different!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Seventhavenians gathered a council at which they began to decide which of them should go to rescue the prisoner from dungeon. After several discussions and debates, they came to the conclusion that it should be done by the youngest of all those present &#8211; namely, twiddler Minstrel. In less than an hour he had already descended the stairs to the High Road, and, stealthily sneaking into Ducal Chateau, slipped into The Duchess&#8217;s bedchamber, where she kept the magic pot. Taking it in hand, Minstrel appealed to its tiny dweller to free the youthful Sagamore. Potted Fairy did not agree to this proposal, and meanwhile the guards heard a noise from the bedchamber. Hearing their stomp, Minstrel fell into a panic and not knowing what to do next, decided to take the most extreme step &#8211; he asked the little beauty, so that she scattered palatial walls, to which Potted Fairy agreed without further ado. And when four warriors had already broken through the doors and seized Minstrel, the building suddenly shook and the heavy ceiling collapsed down, burying everyone who at that time was in the Ducal Chateau&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Really, is Minstrel too?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Yes, him and Potted Fairy died both. Don&#8217;t you cry.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter N.XV<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: &#8220;Of all the Ducal Chateau&#8217;s indwellers only one person survived &#8211; as it is easy to guess, it was youthful Sagamore, who, taking advantage of the general commotion, got out of his cell a moment before the walls of the dungeon collapsed. After wandering around the wreckage for a while, he got out into the regal garden, where at this time among the crowns of fruit trees and neatly trimmed bushes just taking a break from the day&#8217;s worries already familiar to us \u0421lever Crow. Noticing the survivor, bird immediately flew up from the tree and, slowly circling over his head, told youthful Sagamore about what happened with Zelandyne, and then ordered him to wait until nightfall to climb the crystalline staircase to heaven. Having finished his narrative, Clever Crow flapped his wings and soared into the air, leaving youthful Sagamore alone in the regal garden&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Ajussi Japh, what happened next?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Our fairy tale has reached its end.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Listen, no, hold on, hold on!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: So, did you enjoy this fairy tale?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Yeah, that delighted me. I expected it to end in a corny way, but\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: What do you mean by &#8220;corny way&#8221;?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Well\u2026 If the youthful Sagamore found the marchioness and kissed her, and they were happy, then it would be quite flatly, although romantic\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Japh, It\u2019s already difficult for Delia to describe her feelings, and you\u2019re pestering her with your questions. That won&#8217;t do, mate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Let&#8217;s go and eat something, there&#8217;s still time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Enjoy your meal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: What are you writing there, ajussi Japh?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: So, memos for my hobby.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Open it up to page ninety one and read.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Hey, this is my own words! I said them when you were reading me a fairy tale!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: This is for my research regarding American citizens having Greek names.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: It&#8217;s a pity, of course, that you don&#8217;t have sweets at home, but since we are not here to praise your culinary talents, let&#8217;s come to the point.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Listen to me, Delia. When you and I go home, don\u2019t even think about talking to anyone about what happened. Do you understand?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Unfortunately not. What are you on about?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Fairy tale, about fairy tale.

I don&#8217;t want them to think that you heard a some baloney from ajussi Japh.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Well, ajussi Jo. You told me the same thing when you read me that book in German\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Yes-yes, about Lord God in the flesh. There was a reason there too, but it&#8217;s not relevant. Now you have to remember &#8211; act as if nothing happened, is that clear?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Okay.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: Do you promise to hold your tongue?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I make a promise I won&#8217;t tell anyone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan Thurlow: You&#8217;re a very intelligent girl.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Japhet Byrnes: Best of luck out there!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter N.XVI<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Mister Yonce: Shouldn&#8217;t be doing that.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Mom, why can&#8217;t I go to ajussi Jo?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mister Yonce: Because, that neighbourly dog went mad from the heat and ran away, and now he&#8217;s wandering around and might bump into you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Are you not going to let me go at all?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mister Yonce: We can let you go outside, but don&#8217;t go to your neighbour.

I would never have united these four cases under the same roof if not for one curious fact &#8211; the names of all the victims were of Greek origin.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: You&#8217;re talking about your supernatural rubbish again!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: If mister Maurice thinks that I am making the deaths look like some kind of anti-scientific nonsense, then let him continue to think so, but I am not going to give up my investigation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: I&#8217;ll ask inspector Pharqraut to return to exposition of his case.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: So, I&#8217;ll start in order. The first victim was Theodore Beckel, a janitor at the Union Way. At first sight, what happened to him was nothing more than an accident &#8211; while returning home from his evening shift, the poor man was hit by a car.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Where did it happen?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Right at the marked crosswalk in front of the shopping center. Death came instantly, the wheels of the car turned his head into a bloody mess.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What is it with him?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: Haematophobia, the guy is afraid of the mere mention of blood and gore.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: How did you manage to identify the body?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Understand that the body belonged to a fifty-year-old Union Way janitor was child&#8217;s play &#8211; attached to his work uniform was a badge that read &#8220;T. Beckel&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Very good, what&#8217;s next?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Now I will begin to describe the second victim &#8211; Penelope Conway, twenty-year-old saleswoman in duty-free shop, specializing in all kinds of powders &#8211; washing, insect repellents and so on.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: The saleswoman was found dead in her apartment, her body was discovered by her own aunt, who came to her to give her some book telling about ancient Greek myths.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Cause of death?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: This is a difficult question from a medical point of view. No signs of violence or visible injuries were found on the body of the deceased.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: I guess it might be poison.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Do you think Penelope Conway committed suicide?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: I haven\u2019t seen this lady&#8217;s corpse, how can I know for sure? I&#8217;m just make assumptions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: What was the woman wearing when her body was discovered?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Well\u2026 The deceased was wearing a light white dress, cinched with satin ribbon.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: What about shoes?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: The saleswoman had alpargatas on her feet with ties around the ankle.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.III<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pharqraut: Next we will talk about thirty-two-year-old Alexander O&#8217;Brent. He was, to put it mildly\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: He was a conductor of night-walkers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Pimpf, he was pimpf.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: You probably misspoke.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: I want to add, that prior to this, mister O&#8217;Brent came from Atlanta, state Georgia, where he worked as a cashier at Chick-fil-A.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: Huh, at first this dropout was selling fried chickens, and then switched to different chicks!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Determining what Alexander O&#8217;Brent died from was an easy task. His body was found in the room of Eastside Lodge, where he was called by one of his subordinates.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Name of light-o&#8217;-love?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Miss F\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: S-s-sorry, pleas-s-se!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: On what issue did fille de joie call mister O&#8217;Brent?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: It was a trivial point. She came across a nervous client who categorically refused to pay.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Name of client?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Thirty-four year old Eugene Woods, we have not yet been able to establish his place of work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Try harder.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: As a matter of fact, O&#8217;Brent met his death in his motel room. The client fell into a state of passion and right in front of the fancy woman stabbed pimpf in the ribs with a knife, and when he fell to the floor, mister Woods began to kick him in a rage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: When the police arrived at the crime scene, then Alexander has only a terrible bloody pulp left in place of his manhood.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: The last victim was Dennis Lang. He was an entomologist living in the Portland suburbs. Generous heart\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: You&#8217;re starting to drool.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: He died as a true altruist. Dennis gave his life to save another person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Mister Maurice is right, you should focus on the facts, not the personality of the deceased.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: All right. Lang was once walking near his house and saw a little boy running away from a mad dog with heart-rending screams.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You speak as if you were an eyewitness to what happened.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: These details were given to me by his neighbour, missis Taggert.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: In general, the entomologist rushed to help the baby, but unfortunately he tripped on a stone and fell right in front of the hound&#8217;s nose, which did not deny itself the pleasure of attacking the man lying in front of him.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Is everything okay with that kid?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Little boy was rescued, but at the cost of the life of his saviour. When poor Dennis Lang was taken to the hospital, his body was so damaged by the teeth of a rabid animal that he, without regaining consciousness, left this world in a hospital bed that evening.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: What happened to mad dog?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: According to missis Taggert, hound, having finished with the entomologist, ran away in an unknown direction. We didn&#8217;t bother looking for her.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Of course, because our smaller brothers stemming from garbage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: You forgot that a dog can have an owner.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Never mind.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Well, gentlemen, I hope inspector Pharqraut&#8217;s story gave you an idea of the kind of case our police department was faced with. Now it&#8217;s time to give your comments on this matter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: I have been practising criminal medicine for fifteen years now, but I can&#8217;t overemphasize how mister Pharqraut managed to put together four completely different deaths.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: I state that death by rabid dog bites and death under the wheels of a car, of course, there are similarities in that they are accidents, but\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: I&#8217;m disgusted when people don&#8217;t look before they leap.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maurice: How dare you speak to me in this manner?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: With the departure of the man on whose case we have gathered in this office, I think I can call the meeting officially closed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Oh tobacco, you the world\u2026<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.IV<a href=\"https:\/\/avlivro.fandom.com\/wiki\/Subtitles?veaction=edit&amp;section=24\"><\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Galbraith: Lord, where am I drifting?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Looks like somebody is having fun with me.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.V<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Galbraith: I was there at the birth\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Come on out, newborn, try to devour your obstetrician!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anderson: What&#8217;ll it be?

Because the heat is fierce\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Yes, I&#8217;m going about my deals, and I see you standing in the alley, looking at some rappers. When you laughed and began to run away from them, I decided to follow you &#8211; you never know, I&#8217;ll have to protect you from these trinity. And I noticed that you turned into a dead end. Well, I think that my friend, out of fear, without understanding the road, went wherever his eyes looked. I follow you and see that you are running circles in front of the mirror, like a dog that wants to catch its tail. I run up to you, and you open your mouth and your eyes are so bulging. I figured that you&#8217;ll be swinging. I couldn&#8217;t find any other way to stop your madness other than to hit you over the head and drag you out here.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: You don&#8217;t got a headache?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: No, it doesn&#8217;t hurt. I just couldn&#8217;t open my eyes or move my tongue.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Probably numbness, or some sort of a paralysis. How did you even get into this condition? Maybe you injected yourself with something, huh?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Go take your narcotics away somewhere else, Pharqraut, you know me\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: What other word is there for it? Do you really want to convince me that you were so scared of those three African-Americans that you decided to hide from them in some dead end and, thinking that no one would see you there, you gave vent to your nerves?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I&#8217;m not going to persuade you, bud\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: In this case, tell me what you yourself felt at that moment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I swear narcotics have nothing to do with that. I just left the bar and, on my way to Rollo Street, I happened to pass by an alley where three gangsta rappers were preparing to shoot each other over some trifle. I laughed to distract them from this idea, and calmly walked on. And, not knowing that this was a dead end, he entered the passage. But I&#8217;m afraid you may not believe what happened next\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: I&#8217;ll believe you, don&#8217;t worry. Okay, continue.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay. In the passage, I came close to the mirror and suddenly noticed that my reflection did not react to my movements. And then I felt an earthquake begin. I wanted to run back, but everything was blocked behind me. And then a wave of blood poured out of the mirror onto me. Choking, I lost consciousness. Thank you for, as it turns out, following me all this time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: Don&#8217;t consider me your guardian angel, buddy. Well, you&#8217;ve taken a great trip\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You still think it&#8217;s a narcotic?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pharqraut: I don&#8217;t think so anymore, I just can&#8217;t describe your incident any other way.

I think the young lady can tell you anything else.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: So, so, so\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Your name?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Don&#8217;t be scared, sweetie. We just want you to gave us the essence of things. Good?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Will you tell us what your name is?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Delia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Listen, Delia, you won&#8217;t say a few words about how your mom, well, that&#8217;s the most\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Ascended unto heaven?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Did she tell you that herself?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Yes. Mommy took daddy&#8217;s gun and told me not to cry when she will ascend unto heaven.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Did your mother never ascended before, when she giving herself injections?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Do not listen to him, he was only joking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Tell me, where is your father?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Do you know where he might be now?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Why won&#8217;t you speak?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Easy, tiger! If you don&#8217;t know how to work with children and only attack them, then stay where you are and don\u2019t interfere. It&#8217;s clear?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Bravo, mister inspector, bravo!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: So, Delia, your mother&#8217;s got the gun. What did she do before that?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Before this, mommy was lying in bed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Are you saying that\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I went to her and asked when dad would be back. She said she didn&#8217;t know and wept.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I began to console mommy, but she asked me to go for a walk. I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone, but I obeyed.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And when did you return?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: After half an hour. I went home and saw mommy standing in front of the mirror. I asked her what she was doing, but she raised hand with the gun to head.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You said a minute ago that she told you something before that?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: When mommy fell, I ran to her and she whispered to me not to cry.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Was it true?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Her voice was almost inaudible. But I understood from her eyes what she wanted to say.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay, Delia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Do you have relatives in the center?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Relatives?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, uncle, aunt, grandmother\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: I only have dad and mom.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: From now on, it&#8217;s only dad\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Appositely when will he come?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: He&#8217;s sick, he needs to get treatment.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: And when will he be cured?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I can\u2019t say, the disease is serious.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.IX<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Galbraith: Do you have close friends or classmates?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: No.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Nothing at all? Okay, not close ones, just your acquaintances?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Really, no!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay Delia, I get it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, this isn&#8217;t good. Apparently, the guardianship authorities will have to be involved in this matter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Don&#8217;t look so glum. We have not yet made a request to search for her relatives. The young lady may not have known her parents&#8217; cousins or second cousins by sight, but this does not mean that she is alone in this world.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You&#8217;re an optimist, Matt, I&#8217;ve always liked that about you, but here&#8217;s a case\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: All is not lost, mister inspector.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Suit yourself. But still, where should we place her until the circumstances are clarified?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: You can talk to that woman, the witness. They, it seemed to me, knew each other well.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Sergeant Saussure, don&#8217;t you know where that woman went?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saussure: Which one, mister inspector?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, with a scarf on her head\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saussure: You mean Elsebeth Roselieu? She went out the gate and the trail went cold.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Yes, couldn&#8217;t be better\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Matt, where&#8217;s the baby?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: The girl went upstairs. Said she wanted to change clothes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: All right. I&#8217;ll go away for now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Where you&#8217;re headed, if it&#8217;s not indiscreet?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: Am I not coming with you?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, you know\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Mister inspector, while you were in the bathroom, the telephone rang upstairs. I picked up the phone and was ordered to report to you to come to the police department immediately.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Curious\u2026 Did the caller not introduce himself?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: No, but from the voice I determined that the subscriber was aged.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Approved. Now you listen to me. If I have now been ordered to leave, then I do not dare disobey the orders of my superiors, but I want you let this eat into your mind &#8211; if it&#8217;s in your stupid head the idea to be rude to this girl will come again, I swear what am I will scrape you out from earth. You got that?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>F.B.I. Agent: Roger, mister inspector!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, way to go.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: This guy told me that you are going to the police now. Well, good luck to you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Thanks for saying that, Matt.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Then farewell, Delia.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delia Yonce: What, you are leaving me?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Stay here, but I need to go to the city. We&#8217;ll take care of you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Sorry, do you know how to get to the center from here?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patricia: Did you are not a local? You might have killed me!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patricia: You can get to the center from here by bus. You&#8217;re just in time for\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Where is the stop?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patricia: Will you walk along this road, then turn right, go past the tobacco shop, and then go straight. When you hit the concrete barrier, turn left and there will be a bus stop\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Thanks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Patricia: You&#8217;ll reach the city in about forty minutes!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Outside the bullseye again!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Imagine that you are aiming not at an abstract figure, but at your enemy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Yeah, I have trouble keeping up with you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Listen, Galbraith. I understood your health condition and decided to suit your sensibilities.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: An if more specifically?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: With this in mind, you must rest and relax. There will be no tasks until the day after tomorrow.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I am flattered, but\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: However, it is necessary. We are not machines, Galbraith. Policemen, like all people, also need recreation. I give you permission to spend one day as you please.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, I won&#8217;t dare to disobey the your order.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anderson: &#8220;Brown Horse&#8221;?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Is that really me?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.X<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Billeteur: So, did you bent at such an early hour?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: No-no, I just was staring at that sign.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: I know you Americans, it is the morning, the drinking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, where are you from?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: I? Ich bin Deutscher!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Are they showing a movie here?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: How else? For German immigrants, onkel Korble founded a small cinema here two years ago.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And what films are shown here?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: In Deutsch, of course. However, if you don\u2019t know our language at all, this is not a problem.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Can I come to the session?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: You&#8217;re just in time, last seat left.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: All right, then I&#8217;m all in.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.XI<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Galbraith: Have you seen this film yourself?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: How could I not watch what I was going to show to the audience?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, what do you think of it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: I have no idea if you know, but this director, to put it mildly, specializes in films for adults, so the creation itself is appropriate.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And if you dig little deeper?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: So, it&#8217;s actually based on a Russian book.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Have you read it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: Never had a chance. But experts say that the director did not understand its essence and ended up filming rare nonsense.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: If you&#8217;re asking me about this film like that, does that mean it made an impression on you?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I like it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: Ha-ha! If you, an American, liked the delusional creation of not the best German director, then I&#8217;m even afraid to imagine the depths to which your own filmmakers have sunk!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: The machine of your cinema consists more than entirely of parts stolen in Europe! You steal the worst ideas of our directors and make this, as you call it, a business out of it! Your cinema is not dead, it has been dead since birth!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay, okay, I understand. By the way, aren&#8217;t you Korble himself?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: You are probably the first person to confuse me with onkel Korble! Every German here knows him!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, I&#8217;m not German.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Billeteur: I&#8217;m his right hand, if it hasn&#8217;t dawned on you yet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Good luck staying here!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Norman Van Riesen: Maestro, say &#8220;voc\u00ea&#8221;! &#8220;Voc\u00ea&#8221; means &#8220;you&#8221;!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Good day, Matt!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Hi.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Do you know how young lady Yonce is doing?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: This is the essence of things.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I&#8217;m sorry\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Today&#8217;s news stinks\u2026 Buddy, you&#8217;re not in a hurry, are you?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: No\u2026 But why do they stinks?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Listen here. Anyway, when we brought the girl here, she began to complain about, well, as is usual with womankind\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What, you mean it&#8217;s a Delia started menstruating? In ten years?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Yeah, it&#8217;s rare, but it&#8217;s not impossible. But I&#8217;m not going to talk about that. In short, medic Maurice came up to her complaint and she began to describe to him\u2026 Briefly, then girl said that she had a parasite inside her\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: That doesn&#8217;t make any sense.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Of course she didn&#8217;t put it that way, they are no such thing. In general, Maurice became worried and told the girl to be taken to Randall Children&#8217;s Hospital and volunteered to accompany her himself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: So keep doing it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Then I can only remember what he himself told me, since I was not an eyewitness to those events.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: In general, Maurice with Delia arrived at Randall Children&#8217;s Hospital, and there they immediately went to see a gynaecologist. He, having examined the patient, said that she really had something inside\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Erm\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: No, it wasn&#8217;t pregnancy, this is something else.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.XII<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Matt MacLaren: And then the gynaecologist told Maurice that they would put the young lady in the ward for now and begin preparations for the operation to remove\u2026 Oh, forgot this medical term\u2026 But I remember that, according to Maurice, that man had never encountered anything like this before in his entire career.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: A rather interesting story\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: I have not yet finished. Then Maurice, leaving his home phone number to the gynaecologist, left the hospital and went home. This was the day before yesterday.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay, so what happened next?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: And yesterday they called him late in the evening &#8211; they said that they had already looked at everything and prepared for everything, and tomorrow they would perform a hysterectomy on the little girl.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What exactly do they do?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Uterus removal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: My God!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: I am also shocked by it too, like you. Even at twenty-eight years old, such an operation is already a serious step, but here is a little child\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Why they decided to do it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: All right, bud, cool.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Tell me why?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: Well\u2026 Maurice told me that this thing &#8211; I don\u2019t remember the term &#8211; almost completely grown into the endometrium, and without complete removal of the uterus, the gynaecologist saw no other way to help the young lady.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: And this morning Maurice received a call that the girl, how should I put it\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Don&#8217;t hesitate, please\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: In general, staff of Randall Children&#8217;s Hospital said that her pulse had stopped being palpable.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What was the name of the gynaecologist who led the operation?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: I recall Maurice saying it was\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Name, bud, I need a name!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matt MacLaren: How you much hotter\u2026 So, he told me that the gynaecologist introduced himself to him as doctor Baselard.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>R.C.H. Operator: You called Randall Children&#8217;s Hospital.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Hello, could you give me doctor Baselard&#8217;s home address?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>R.C.H. Operator: We do not disclose personal\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I&#8217;m from Portland Police Bureau.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>R.C.H. Operator: Okay, hold the line.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: It&#8217;s you doctor Baselard?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: May I ask what this is regarding?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: I hope your interest in my person is not too comprehensive\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Don&#8217;t worry, the police just have a few questions for you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Let&#8217;s drink tea and in a quiet atmosphere you will answer me\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: I&#8217;ll put the kettle on, but you can ask questions right now.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You&#8217;re at it in a hurry?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: To England, on affairs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Good. You just got out of surgery, I take it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: It feels like you&#8217;re clairvoyant, mister.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Really, no need for compliments. Who was operated on?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: That so small, so plain thing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What were you doing before?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: Well, I did all kinds of surgeries.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: In America?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: Both in America and in England, where, in fact, I was born.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: All right.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: So, you drink tea with sweets or just like that?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I love marmalade. Do you have a couple of pieces?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: Hmm\u2026 I will try to fulfill your plea.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter I.XIII<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Galbraith: This is definitely the same person.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: You killed this woodcutter twenty-four years ago. And this morning there was a little girl under your X-acto knife. She walked towards her destiny, could change the course of history, but unfortunately\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: What do you want from me, you worm? A confession? Here&#8217;s your confession!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: I disposed with theirs souls like Lord God, because I felt like doing it, do you understand?!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: Only don&#8217;t come near me, you wronged, trembling creature!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baselard: You won&#8217;t go on?! Get out of here!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saussure: How can I help you, mister inspector? Here&#8217;s the thing, one citizen is from Portugal. Accompanied by three of his friends, he arrived here and wants to urgently talk with our superiors\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saussure: But they don&#8217;t have time to wait, they&#8217;re in a hurry to get to the airport.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Well, Galbraith, let&#8217;s see what you dug up there. Will you please take a seat?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: The first picture shows a woodcutter who died twenty-four years ago. It happened in Gloucester, where I spent my childhood. The poor guy died right on the operating table &#8211; they opened his brain to remove the tumour. And in the second picture shows the Yonce family with their little daughter, who would have celebrated her eleventh birthday next year, but unfortunately she died this morning in a room at Randall Children&#8217;s Hospital after surgery to remove a vital internal organ.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: So\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: The same person is behind both of these deaths &#8211; doctor Baselard, who was worked in the hospital I mentioned. I say &#8220;was&#8221; because this morning, just after the death of the child, the doctor packed his things and left for England, in order, I am sure, to avoid prosecution.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I don&#8217;t expect him to return to America.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: You are aware, Galbraith. You are clearly so concerned about the fate of this young lady that I feel obliged to send you to Jordan Thurlow.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Excuse me, but who that is?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: A person who is serving a sentence in Columbia River Correctional Institution. He was sentenced to eighteen years in prison on suspicion of raping an underage girl who was the daughter of his neighbours. The court accused him of taking advantage of her mother&#8217;s trust and forcing her to visit his house, where he put pressure on her.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Before his arrest, mister Thurlow, according to the victim&#8217;s parents, abused her at his friend&#8217;s apartment. In general, it is worth noting that the girl had a very emotional father, he was ready to literally do anything to put both men behind bars, but the court ruled that Jordan&#8217;s friend was not proven.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, and what do you suggest I do?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: Ride to Columbia River Correctional Institution and ask to have an audience with this prisoner. As far as I know, he&#8217;s actually not a bad guy at all, but the power of public reprimand\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What will I get out of this?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaeymoure: That it depends only on you, Galbraith. Maybe peace of mind, or maybe a thirst for action.

Just like a whale cannot live in the ocean without plankters, so a policeman cannot exist in a society without a perpetrator.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaufensterpuppe: There must exist in the world constabulary and coffins, before whom they are obliged to perform their service. In the crime of doctor Baselard lies your serenity, and in his person &#8211; salvation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Schaufensterpuppe: And that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll never catch him. After all, with his capture, your own existence will come to its logical end. And there is no mistake in my words &#8211; the whole thing about the young lady who died after doctor Baselard&#8217;s surgery, is not so much an event of the present as a harbinger of the future.

It would be a completely useless appendage that would absorb the excess energy of your body, but it would not do anything useful.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I have no idea but that was really interestingly.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: \u2026but since you have this from birth, you think that this is the normal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: And therefore trying to remove this organ can lead to serious complications because your body\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Are you saying that the chances of Delia surviving were zero?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: With this thing inside, I don&#8217;t know, but it is a fact that removing of it led to death.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Poor girl\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: But I can say one thing for sure, even if she wanted to, a girl as an adult could not conceive and bear a child.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Hmm\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: Do you think that if you have some kind of thing grown into your womb, then there will be a place for the baby there too?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I wouldn&#8217;t think such a thing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nelissen: Okay, let&#8217;s end the conversation.

And how many people have you directed to the right path?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: So far, not a singre one, you are the first to receive such an honour.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Montesi was an engineer-constructor who, from his school days, cherished the idea of \u200b\u200bcreating an eternal supercomputer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What-what?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Eternal in that sense that the integrated circuits that form the basis of the machine do not wear out over time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Of course, subject to operating conditions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Mister Manabu is right, a supercomputer will not last a day if left in the rain, but who would come up with the idea of such an act of vandalism?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, yes\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: All in all, Montesi, as a student, moved from his native Chile to England, and in its capital he quickly found people interested in this.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Do you want to say that in London there were some naive technology manufacturers who took the word of some South American student and fulfilled his whims?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: It is incredible but it is a fact.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Why, pray tell, did this Montesi need to dig this shaft?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Cold War. He did not want the intelligence services to interfere with his work.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Adrian Montesi with his charges in a couple of years created a prototype of a supercomputer. The development was carried out directly underground &#8211; workshops were erected there that assembled microcircuits, memory units and other components.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: It sounds like a fragment from some fantastic story.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: The fierd of science in which we work wirr arways seem rike science fiction to the common man.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Therefore, I will try not to use terms that will not be clear to you in any case.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Thanks for your kind words.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: The very first program that was recorded in the computer&#8217;s memory it was extremely primitive, there was no question of it simulating our world.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And now what, is he already simulating?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Don&#8217;t go getting too far ahead!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Adrian Montesi eventually achieved his goal, and the computer could function forever and without stopping.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And then he took his secret to the grave?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Don&#8217;t blaspheme, Montesi is alive!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay, I was joking.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: The inventor was so excited about his success that at the end of the test run of the computer, he immediately rushed to The Intellectual Property Office of the United Kingdom and registered the trademark &#8220;Mon-Tec&#8221;, which was short for &#8220;Montesi Technologies&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Somehow this act does not fit with the way he previously hid his developments from the intelligence services.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Eidorian Monteshi was a very passionate gaijin. No one courd understand what was going on in his head.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Why do you both talk about him in the past tense?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: You should know it when Montesi registered the trademark, he spoke at an international congress. The only one who was interested in the Chilean&#8217;s invention was professor Makoto Shugarami.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Makoto-san buirt a theory that computer programming is something rike human training, when the resurt shourd not be an automatic machine that executes the program embedded in it, but an artificiar interrigence that courd think and think on its own, without operator intervention.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Well, is a strong word.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Aras, in his homerand Makoto-san had a bad reputation, scientists despised him and carred his thoughts as empty chatter.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Huh, a typical story about an unrecognized genius.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: And therefore, when the professor rearned about the creation of Eidorian Monteshi, he fert that with this gaijin he wourd be abre to rearize his dream of creating an artificiar worrd.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Makoto showed Montesi a prototype of his program, which, based on the information entered into it, produced quite meaningful sentences in response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: It&#8217;s rike when a baby repeats an adurt&#8217;s actions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Do you want to say that some unknown Japanese professor developed the von Neumann model and achieved success in it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Unknown is a relative concept. Do you know who Thomas Kite Sharpless is?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: How should I know?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: If you were interested in computers, you would know that this is the chief programmer of Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: All right, you&#8217;ve got it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Makoto&#8217;s program delighted Montesi so much, that he, without thinking twice, appointed a Japanese professor to the post of major programmer of his supercomputer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Makoto-san took with him a staff of his emproyees, among whom was your humbre servant Manabu.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Within two months a team of Japanese programmers worked hard and eventually demonstrated their work to Montesi.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Eidorian Monteshi was so amazed by my teacher&#8217;s unprecedented resurts that he bowed to his genius and handed over the entire project to him.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: But where did he go?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Montesi left the &#8220;Mon-Tec&#8221;. But before leaving, he asked the professor for a favor.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What was it?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: He had two requests, so that they completely forget about it and at the same time change the brand.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And what were the successes?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: &#8220;Mon-Tec&#8221; has been re-registered under the new name, &#8220;Makoto Computerization Institute&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: But no one courd forget about Eidorian Monteshi himserf.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Did he really leave of his own free will?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Makoto-san personarry begged Eidorian Monteshi-kun not to abandon his brainchird, but the gaijin was adamant.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Okay, so what happened next?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: When the staff of the institute was headed by Makoto Shugarami, all participants began working on the creation of &#8220;Makoto&#8217;s Chest&#8221;, that&#8217;s what the professor himself called his creation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And what did the programmers put in this chest?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: All kinds of information began to be entered into the supercomputer memory blocks, starting from sciences such as algebra or philosophy and ending with such small things as prices for tickets to Africa or a top list of the best perfumes for young girls.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I&#8217;ve never heard so much codswallop. Why fill a supercomputer with all sorts of nonsense?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Makoto-san wanted for a computer to have so much information about our worrd, to buird a his virtuar copy based on it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kenbutsunin: Manabu-kun no tonari ni tatte iru kono baka wa daredesu ka?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Namakemono: Kore ga watashitachi no gesutoda to omoimasu.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Excuse me, what did these gentlemen say?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: These two said that they are very preased to wercome a distinguished guest to our institute!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: By the way, do they live here or\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Only working.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: And how do they get here?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: By taxi\u2026<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I mean how they go underground.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: By the elevator, of course.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: What, these Japanese don&#8217;t lose consciousness while they&#8217;re coming down here?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manabu: Physicar training.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: Maybe it&#8217;s just a matter of habit?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: And that too.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chapter III.XV<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ichinose Okamura: Hello.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shinoda Okamura: Greetings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: These are our new employees.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Galbraith: I hope their names will not be a secret to me?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specialist: Of course not.
