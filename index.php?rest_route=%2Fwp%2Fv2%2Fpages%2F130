This is of course unintentional.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AlmostDeadGuy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Almost Dead Guy<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father gets into an accident and ends up in the hospital with a head injury that leaves him almost unable to speak.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AliensInCardiff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aliens in Cardiff<\/a>: Acts 0, 1, and 2 take place in Portland, Oregon. This city rarely gets featured in media.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/TheAce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Ace<\/a>: In the first and second acts of the story, Galbraith uses his position as a police inspector to impress people (by scaring them with his ID, of course).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptedOut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adapted Out<\/a>: Despite being based on the film\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Omen_IV:_The_Awakening\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Omen IV: The Awakening<\/a>, it doesn&#8217;t actually use much of its main ideas. For example, monks, Satanists and politicians completely disappeared from the work, as well as nannies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalVillainy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Villainy<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father in the film was simply a man who turned a blind eye to his daughter&#8217;s antics. In &#8220;Always Visible&#8221;, he is essentially the one who drove a character named Jo to his death.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalJobChange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Job Change<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father was a congressman in the film; in Always Visible, he became a pharmacist. A character named Jo also became a culturologist from a psychic nanny.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationDistillation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptation Distillation<\/a>: Elements of Satanism are removed without a trace, and the influence of politics on the plot is also limited to only modest references to the USSR threat to America.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationNameChange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptation Name Change<\/a>: It&#8217;s easier to say about those who have NOT changed their name. This is Delia, Jerome and Jo. In the latter case, it is short for Jordan, not Josephine. Also, syntactically, Delia&#8217;s parents&#8217; last name, Yonce, is very similar to York.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AgeLift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Age Lift<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father was thirty in the film, but in Always Visible he is fifty. On the contrary, the man who is investigating this girl\u2019s case has become twenty years younger.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AwesomeButImpractical\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Awesome, but Impractical<\/a>: D.O.O.R., the supercomputer that simulates virtual reality. There is virtually no benefit from it, and when Galbraith talks about his impressions from it like a movie, scientists are clearly imbued with this idea, because this may give them a chance to use their achievements to at least some benefit.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/ArcSymbol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arc Symbol<\/a>: The apricot tree in the second act, which Jordan saw in the neighbors&#8217; yard, he later sees in his dying dreams.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AscendedExtra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ascended Extra<\/a>: Jordan Thurlow and Galbraith are based on Josephine Thueson and Earl Knight, who were minor characters in the film (albeit with significant screen time)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalSympathy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Sympathy<\/a>: Delia herself is not a demon child, she is simply a child who is sick with an unknown disease, and she gains sympathy from both protagonists without actually doing anything wrong.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalAttractiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Attractiveness<\/a>: The friend of character named Jo in the film was a not-so-young bearded man. In &#8220;Always Visible&#8221; he is replaced by a young, handsome guy with long curly blond hair.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AuthorAppeal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Author Appeal<\/a>: Vitaly Ivolginsky is Russian by nationality, so expect that a work about America will not have authenticity, but will be jam-packed with references to Russian culture, which is alien to Americans.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/Acrofatic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Acrofatic<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father is described as a huge, heavyset old man. If in himself&#8217;s case this is not yet strongly evident, then when his two dopplegangers appear in the work, Galbraith becomes convinced with his own eyes how deceiving this man\u2019s appearance was.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AnAesop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">An Aesop<\/a>: There is a feeling that the main idea that the author is trying to convey is not to be weaklings, the main characters are so clumsy. In the last act of the work, the fact that learning is useful is added to this.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AndNowForSomeoneCompletelyDifferent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">And Now for Someone Completely Different<\/a>: The very first thing you will read is a story from the perspective of a little girl. After this, the role of the POV character will be taken by two men.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AndYourRewardIsClothes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">And Your Reward Is Clothes<\/a>: At the very end of the work, employees of the underground institute give Galbraith&#8230; A fur coat!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AllJustADream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">All Just a Dream<\/a>: All dreams that are described on the pages of the work are nightmares, no exceptions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AlternateUniverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alternate Universe<\/a>: On the one hand, the work tries to correspond to reality &#8211; the characters visit real places and, in addition, they read news that was relevant at the time of the events, but at the same time, the third act of the work makes you think that the protagonist ends up not in London, but in some distorted ersatz copy of it .<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AbusiveParents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abusive Parents<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father is not outright evil, but the story mentions that he once kicked his own daughter out of the table just because the girl did not say a prayer before eating.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationSpeciesChange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Species Change<\/a>: There was only one dog in the film, and it was a Rottweiler. This breed is still mentioned in the newspaper article in &#8220;The Oregonian&#8221;, but the Belgian Malinois appears in the story itself.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalUgliness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Ugliness<\/a>: In the film, Delia&#8217;s father was a handsome thirty-year-old congressman. In &#8220;Always Visible&#8221;, he is replaced by a huge and clumsy pharmaceutist, whom the characters compare to either a gorilla or a bear.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AdaptationalNationality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adaptational Nationality<\/a>: If in the film Delia&#8217;s mother was most likely an ordinary American, then in &#8220;Always Visible&#8221; Ivette Yonce is the daughter of a Portuguese farmer, which is a reference to Asia Molly Vieira.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AndIMustScream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">And I Must Scream<\/a>: Delia&#8217;s father has a difficult life &#8211; first his daughter is disgraced by a neighbor, and then, two years later, he has an accident, due to which he loses the ability to speak intelligently. At least the work does not say whether he died or not.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/ArcWords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arc Words<\/a>: &#8220;Magistratus oportet servire populo&#8221; (The Police must serve The People), a Latin proverb that Galbraith sees before he learns of Delia&#8217;s death. The inspector repeats it when he is already in London in search of the girl\u2019s killer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AsTheGoodBookSays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">As the Good Book Says&#8230;<\/a>: When Pharqraut reprimands Earl Knight, he quotes one of the Ten Commandments, specifically &#8220;Thou shalt not steal&#8221;.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tvtropes.org\/pmwiki\/pmwiki.php\/Main\/AlliterativeName\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alliterative Name<\/a>: Miriam Myron, mother of Jerome. In fact, this surname refers to the famous Soviet actor Andrei Mironov and the name in turn for his daughter Maria.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This page lists tropes of literary work Always Visible (Another Prayer for the Dying Horror Genre) by Russian author Vitaly Ivolginsky, starting with the letter A.
