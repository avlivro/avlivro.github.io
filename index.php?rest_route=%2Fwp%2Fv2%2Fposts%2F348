When Zelandyne had nothing to do, she sat down on a chair in front of the window and listened, how her green friends tell her about what has been and what will be in the world. That day they told marchioness that today she is eighteen years old, and on this occasion, they want to please her with the news that she will meet her fiance, who, as was customary in those distant times, should give her a heart pierced by an arrow. When Zelandyne, delighted by this news, immediately went to the palace hall, Cactus and Chamomile began to whisper among themselves about who the mysterious chosen one of marchioness would look like&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s definitely not a prickly peyote!&#8221;, Delia interrupted him with a laugh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japhet took a breath and, with a satisfied smile, looked at his young listener, continued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some will wonder why the marchioness was so pleased with the news of her birthday. It&#8217;s simple &#8211; the mother tried her best to keep her daughter in the dark about her age, because she was afraid that when the girl turned eighteen, she would not refuse the opportunity to take her place on the throne. Of course, Zelandyne never even thought of that &#8211; all she wanted that day was on the occasion of her birthday throw a merry-making. Approaching the palace hall, on the way she already imagined, how hundreds of candles were lit in it, and hundreds of guests entered, with the arrival of which began the bona fide ball. The marchioness saw with her own eyes the graceful cavaliers, who, sparkling in their eyes and clinking their spurs, danced with elegant ladies, and at the very end of the hall she saw the silhouette of a beautiful young man, to whom she wanted to throw herself into the arms&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japhet&#8217;s reading was interrupted by a muffled yawn &#8211; it was Jordan shifting on leather sofa, bringing a hand up to his face to cover his mouth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It sounded boring&#8221;, Delia admitted honestly, also covering her mouth with her palm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just be patient&#8221;, said ajussi Japh, &#8220;in each fairy tale there are few interesting descriptions of secular life&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Okay&#8221;, answered the girl, wiping her hand on the arm of her chair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But alas&#8221;, continued Japhet, &#8220;In fact, there was a copper cauldron in the palace hall, into which the marchioness&#8217;s mother threw milkweed leaves, snake fangs and wasp stings. The poisonous brew foamed and seethed, and the sorceress herself furiously whispered over it the words of some spells. When the water finally flooded the coals that lay under the cauldron, The Duchess began to interrogate the prisoner in the chain youthful Sagamore, whom, by her silent decree, the guards brought. She wanted to ask the captive, where hide old men, women and children of broken, but not conquered country. But youthful Sagamore, even under penalty of death, did not tell her anything!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajussi Japh uttered the last words with such enthusiasm, as if he was personally present at this interrogation and wholeheartedly sympathized with that young man who had lost his homeland and freedom. His young listener could not resist commenting:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;re brave, daring heart!&#8221;, Delia exclaimed loudly and jumped on the spot, causing her black hair to fall picturesquely over her shoulders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of her adult interlocutors stared at her with some bewilderment, as if trying to understand the reason for her unbridled joy. Jordan even stroked his frizzy hair with his palm, making it look even worse. From his face, the girl realized that he envied her young ardor in his soul, but because of the presence of his close friend tries not to express his feelings in any way. Japhet himself, having looked at the guest from head to toe, only grinned meaningfully and returned to the book, which he continued to hold in his hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When The Duchess understood, what youthful Sagamore does not agree to commit treason to his motherland, she called the guards behind her and, leaving the prisoner alone, went to give instructions to the slaughterers. Just at that moment, Zelandyne reached the palace hall, and what was the surprise of the marchioness when she caught sight of a handsome, but exhausted and chained young man! She immediately rushed to youthful Sagamore and started asking questions, to which he willingly answered, because he felt a kindred spirit in the girl. Hearing his sad story, the heart of the young marchioness was filled with readiness to regain freedom to youthful Sagamore, but what could her fragile hands do?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wonder what ideology adhered Leonard Austener, who wrote this fairy tale?&#8221;, thoughtfully said ajussi Jo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What are you even talking about?&#8221;, not understanding the friend&#8217;s words, asked Japhet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just think about this, mate&#8221;, with the air of a connoisseur began Jordan, &#8220;this author has a representative of the feudal class became sympathetic to the leader of the oppressed people. Don&#8217;t you find that this is some kind of prerequisite for mutiny, a overturn?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Will you please stop!&#8221;, Delia interrupted his ranting about politics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I agree with you&#8221;, ajussi Japh supported the girl and continued reading. &#8220;But at this time in the palace hall came back the Zelandyne&#8217;s mother, who, having found her daughter next to the prisoner, immediately ordered to send youthful Sagamore to the dungeon, and she herself attacked the marchioness with loud reproaching cries. When The Duchess realized that objurgations would not help the cause, she gave Zelandyne a pearl-encrusted diadem. In this sparkling attire, the young marchioness seemed so beautiful to everyone, that after her departure, the alarmed woman immediately rushed to her chambers, that ask the Potted Fairy. Answer of little beauty scared her in earnest &#8211; according to her forecasts, Zelandyne was supposed to throw The Duchess off the throne any minute&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to the fairy tale, Delia imperceptibly let out a deep sigh. Ajussi Japh looked up from his book and looked at her with a smile. The girl blushed slightly and lowered her eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I just thought The Duchess was a bit like my mommy&#8221;, she spoke softly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Interesting, what exactly?&#8221;, Jordan couldn&#8217;t resist asking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To tell the truth&#8221;, little girl began, &#8220;mother also has the same mood swings &#8211; then it seems to her that everything is against her, and the next second she is imbued with a great love for the world&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How many years your mom?&#8221;, urgently asked Japhet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the exact age&#8221;, intervened ajussi Jo, &#8220;but she is younger than her fifty-year-old husband by about twenty years&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So, thirty something&#8221;, said ajussi Japh, not in the least surprised at such a difference in the ages of the spouses. &#8220;Midlife crisis, what to take from her\u2026&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both grown men looked at Delia. Baby girl was sitting in a chair, staring at the floor. She had, of course, overheard their conversation about her mother, but she didn&#8217;t care what it was about &#8211; little girl just wanted to hear the continuation of the tale. Japhet exchanged glances with his friend, shrugged and returned to his book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As soon as The Duchess heard Potted Fairy&#8217;s prediction, how her soul was immediately filled with hatred and envy for her own daughter, and she decided to take revenge on the young marchioness. She went through many ways of revenge in her head, and in the end decided sell Zelandyne into slavery to some sea-wolf, who then plowed the sea on their huge schooners. The Duchess immediately called for auld Jaeger, over over which she constantly abusing, and ordered him to carry out her order. Auld Jaeger did not dare to disobey his proprietress and took Zelandyne behind the walls of Ducal Chateau. Passing through the gate, he was about to head to the harbour, where the trading schooners were anchored, but fortunately for the marchioness, they got in the way of Clever Crow, who prompted auld Jaeger, that he can just leave the girl on the High Road, but himself return to The Duchess and report her, that the girl was killed on the way by marauders. Auld Jaeger, who was tormented by sympathy for Zelandyne, immediately followed the wise advice of the bird and turned back to Ducal Chateau, and \u0421lever Crow in turn hid in the branches of an ancient oak that grew by the pathway. Unhappily, The Duchess at the first words of auld Jaeger understood, that she was deceived, and, without listening to his story to the end, ordered her guards to seize auld Jaeger and take into courtyard to trophy guillotine &#8211; the very one that her soldiers got in the war with the people of youthful Sagamore&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some reason, a story about how an unlucky old man got caught in his lies, made Delia so excited that she immediately burst into carefree laughter. Both of her interlocutors looked at each other, as if they were very embarrassed. When the girl calmed down a little, she smiled guiltily at them and straightened her dress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He shouldn&#8217;t have listened other animal&#8217;s advice&#8221;, Delia said smartly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In your words contains a kernel of truth&#8221;, began Jordan, &#8220;but, in my opinion, it is indecent to laugh at death&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So auld Jaeger is fabled!&#8221;, rightly noticed girl. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with laughing at the death of a fictional character?&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the silent reproach that was read in the eyes of ajussi Jo and ajussi Japh, forced her to bite her tongue and shrink into a chair. Fortunately, the silence did not last long &#8211; soon Japhet continued reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Zelandyne was left alone on the High Road. It was night outside, and the young marchioness became frightened and frightened. Afraid of the dark, she began to call her voice to the night skies, and soon to her desperate cries from the darkness arrived Clever Crow, which already familiar to us. Seeing Zelandyne, he ordered her to follow a swarm of kind-hearted fireflies glowing in the gloom. Young marchioness followed his advice, and finally the insects led her to the crystalline staircase, that led straight to heaven. Zelandyne climbed it and ended up in an amazing place, where, among countless clouds, an island soared, on which, among flowers and trees, there were small, but very lovely lodges, with red tiled roofs and white round walls. When the young marchioness came closer to the settlement, a nimble and agile little man ran out to meet her, in one hand was a lute, and in the other a sheet of paper covered with ink&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was Minstrel?&#8221;, exclaimed the girl, remembering the beginning of fairy tale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, who else would it be?&#8221;, ajussi Japh asked a rhetorical question. &#8220;And, as you already guessed, the marchioness ended up in Seventhaven, same magical town!&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All right, It&#8217;s so obvious&#8221;, with a slight annoyance in her voice, Delia gives an holy glare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, she was not at all surprised when ajussi Jo, scratching his knee, grunted mysteriously. Who knows, maybe he heard this fairy tale not for the first time, maybe even knew it by heart. Be that as it may, the girl&#8217;s attention turned again to Japhet, who at that moment, slapping his forehead, buried himself in the book again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thirteenth chapter of \u201cAlways Visible (Another Prayer for the Dying Horror Genre)\u201d, the literary work by Russian author Vitaly Ivolginsky.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":953,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_kad_post_transparent":"","_kad_post_title":"","_kad_post_layout":"","_kad_post_sidebar_id":"","_kad_post_content_style":"","_kad_post_vertical_padding":"","_kad_post_feature":"","_kad_post_feature_position":"","_kad_post_header":false,"_kad_post_footer":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[45,43],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-348","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-always-visible","category-act-0"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Chapter N.XIII &#8212;
